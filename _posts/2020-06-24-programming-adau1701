Download and install CySuiteUSB_3_4_7_B204.exe from here https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/suiteusb-34-usb-development-tools-visual-studio
Download `CY3684 EZ-USB FX2LP Development Kit (Rev. *B)` and install CY3684Setup.exe from the zip https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy3684-ez-usb-fx2lp-development-kit
Disconnect the dsp board from programmer and connect programmer to USB. 
Go to device manager and set the driver to right right windows version here C:\Cypress\USB\CY3684_EZ-USB_FX2LP_DVK\1.1\Drivers (win 8.1 folder seems to work with win 10)

Download and install SigmaStudio v4.5 https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/software/ss_sigst_02.html#software-relatedsoftware

Launch C:\Cypress\Cypress Suite USB 3.4.7\CyConsole\CyConsole.exe
Load ADI_USBi.spt and click the play button 

ADAU1701 board http://www.3e-audio.com/dsp/adau1701-2in4out/


Download 24aa256.zip (24aa256.bix 8kB)
To transfer 24aa256.bix to the EEprom on the CY7C68013A development board:
- Remove jumpers on the CY7C68013A development board,
- Start CyConsole (part of Cypress Suite), Choose menu Options-> EZ-USB interface
- push button lgEEPROM, select the EEPROM file i.e. 24aa256.bix (rename to .iic). Download should start
Leave jumper off to boot from eeprom 


My board was of the 2 jumper model & I think both are the same.
J1 is to connect/disconnect 2 LEDs from Vcc - these LEDs are connected to D0 & D1
J2 controls the high address bit of the EEPROM making it appear at I2C address 0xA0 or 0xA2 depending on the jumper.


3e-audio adau1701 board

J6 - pin 1 (closest to potentiometers) - ADAU1701 CLATCH/WP (write protect), driven high by 3.3V through 10kOhm resistor
J6 - pin 2 eeprom - 24c64 RP - left floating
J6 - pin 3 ground
To program, connect P1 and P3
In normal operation, connect P1 and P2 or leave all unconnected.
